                Campus maintenance is one of the key factors in maintaining the health and quality of
                CHANCO infrastructure.<br/> There is a need to have a mechanism that will enable students
                and other members of the campus to report issues that need repairing e.g. doors, geysers.<br/>
                Also, keep track of the progress of the different maintenance activities, keep records
                and task allocation at the maintenance section.
